Twitter statistics for conferences

I am making a more general conference Twitter statistics repository based on one I did before [here](https://github.com/nfahlgren/pagxxiii_twitter).

I am using the twitteR R package. In this implementation you have to go to https://apps.twitter.com/ to create an app that is used for authentication. After you create an app, navigate to the Keys and Access Tokens tab to find the consumer key and consumer secret values.
